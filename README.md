**Starflower** is a text-based, narrative-driven strategy game built on the **MEAN stack**.
Players find themselves leading a new space colony, leading it to independence, and shaping the continued growth of their country, all while navigating the geopolitical (astropolitical?) nightmare of all the other player nations in the Starflower Galaxy.
Players guide a persistent galaxy through decisions whose consequences unfold over time.

This project is currently in **active development**, and definitely not just because I need a project to pad my portfolio.
